# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Java Swing, where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items while avoiding collision with itself and the walls. This README provides an overview of the game's features, how to play it and its dependencies.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right) using arrow keys.
- **Food Items**: Randomly generated food items appear on the screen for the snake to consume, increasing its length.
- **Scoring**: Keep track of the score based on the number of food items eaten by the snake.
- **Game Over**: Display a game over screen when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Restart**: Option to restart the game after it's over.

## Gameplay

1. **Starting the Game**: Execute the `GamePanel.java` file to launch the Snake Game.
2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
3. **Objective**: Guide the snake to consume as many food items as possible without colliding with itself or the walls.
4. **Scoring**: Each food item consumed increases the score.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls. The final score is displayed.
6. **Restart**: After the game ends, restart the game to play again.
